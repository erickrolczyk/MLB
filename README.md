MLB Team Win Total Projections


Baseball is probably the easiest sport to start doing analytics with - the data is everywhere and highly predictive. Throughout this stream, I tried used 2010-2019 team data to create predictive (some ML some not) models to estimate MLB Team Season Wins based on inputs. I examined using OPS/OPS+, ERA/ERA+, and Fielding Percentage as inputs to my models. Ultimately I decided on using solely ERA and OPS given the simplicity and ease of prior data.
